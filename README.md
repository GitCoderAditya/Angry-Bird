## Introduction

This project is a physics-based game inspired by Angry Birds. It leverages **Matter.js** for realistic physics simulations and **p5.js** for rendering and interactive graphics.

## Features

- **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Realistic physics interactions with Matter.js.
- **Interactive UI**: Developed with p5.js for smooth graphics and user interaction.
- **Customizable Levels**: Easy to modify and create new levels with various structures and targets.
- **Simple Controls**: Click and drag to launch birds and aim at targets.

## Technologies Used

- **Matter.js**: A 2D physics engine for the web.
- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library for creating graphical and interactive content.
- **HTML/CSS**: For basic structuring and styling of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactions.
